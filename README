Introduction
============

Gabriel is a simple utility to enable D-Bus clients to connect to a D-Bus
daemon running on a remote machine, through ssh.

Installing Gabriel
======================

(0) To build Gabriel client, you need to have libssh (>= 0.2) [1]
    and glib (> 2.10) installed.
    
    For Gabriel server scripts, you need socat and dbus (> 1.0.2)
    installed on your machine.

(1) Type:

    ./configure

(2) make
(3) make install

Usage Notes
=============

Gabriel is composed of a client-side and a server side:

The server side is actually just a small dbus configuration file and
a pair of scripts that start and shut-down a dbus-daemon with that
configuration file.

Here is the usage for the Gabriel server scripts:

    gabriel-server-start [PID_FILE]
    gabriel-server-stop [PID_FILE]

Where PID_FILE is the path to the file where the PID of the dbus-daemon
will be stored. If no PID_FILE is specified, /tmp/gabriel-server.pid
is asumed. 

The client side is the actual thing and is therefore a binary named,
gabriel. Following is it's usage:

  gabriel [OPTION...] - Gabriel

  -b, --bind=LOCALHOST        The address to listen for DBus client
                              connections on

                              connections on

Upon successful launch, gabriel will inform you about the D-Bus Bus
address you need to use for your D-Bus clients.
