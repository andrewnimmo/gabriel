* Support for multiple client connections at the same time:
  
  Fix already available at http://static.fi/~zeenix/repos/gabriel-multiclient
  but it doesn't work since libssh is not thread-safe. However the
  developer has promised to make things better in this respect in the next
  release.

* Make the code more glib main-loop centric:

  This would require:

  1. The new CHANNEL API promised by the Aris in the next release of libssh
  2. To write a very glib friendly (async and GIOChannel-based) wrapper around
     libssh. This wrapper should ideally either go into libssh intself or
     libgnet.
