* Support for multiple client connections at the same time:
  
  Fix already available at http://static.fi/~zeenix/repos/gabriel-multiclient
  but it doesn't work since libssh is not thread-safe. However the
  developer has promised to make things better in this respect in the next
  release.

* Launch a normal session bus listening on the abstract socket:

  This would require socat to support these kind of sockets. A feature-request
  has already been delivered to the developer(s) but I will get on it if
  he/they don't act soon enough.
